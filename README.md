# Medical Study Application
---------------------------
---------------------------

## What is this project?:

Grey's 101 is a Medical Study Application that I created for my term project in the 15-112 course at CMU during the 2019 Fall Semster. This app uses a variety of interactive techniques to help students learn their anatomy. Python was the primary languge used to write this application.

## Files included:

Tp.py is the python file that runs the code. Other files included in the repository include image files used for the application as well as mp3 files that are used for the sound effects. 

## Libraries used and instructions:
1. OpenCV:
    Install in terminal with the following command: pip install opencv-python.At the top of the .py file write import cv2 as cv.
2. Webbrowser:
    I didn't end up installing this in my terminal. Just said import webbroswer at the top of .py file and it worked.
3. MessageBox:
    MessageBox is part of tkinter. So on top of the .py file just write: 
    from tkinter import message box
4. PyGame:
    To get pygame for audio purposes. Type into terminal: pip install pygame
	Then on the top of your .py file write: 
    from pygame import mixer

## Primary Algorithms used:
* Color Space Image Segmentation
* Canny Edge Detection
